    "* You can think of t_alpha and alpha as a way of simulating a  person controlling the slider where they make a discrete number of changes over the length of the recording\n",
    "E.g. if t_alpha = [0,2.5, 7.5] and alpha = [1.0, 2.0, 0.5], then the first 2.5 sec of the original audio should be played with no TSM, the next 7.5 - 2.5 = 5 sec of the original audio should be played with time stretch factor 2x, and the rest of the recording should be played with time stretch factor 0.5.\n",
